# Assistive-Device_FYP
Developing a device that could potentially guide and assist people who are visually impaired. This is done by using sensors for detection, and other functionalities that would assist users during unfortunate scenarios.


## Draft Documentation
-using python to integrate sensors
-used a prototyping breadboard which can only fir 2 ultrasonic sensors (have to buy a new one)
-2 resistors used for each sensor to avoid the pi from being fried
-using 1 sensor was successfull, 2 sensors, unfortunately no
-successfully detecting distanced and giving warning when a particular distance is detected
-sounds were downloaded from the internet
-sound will be updated to make it more modern by using human voices?
-detection will also be calibrated to check moving objects to avoid the unnecessary warnings.
